Hello Reader this is my Internship assignment at Erino 

It has jwt based authentication and is built using next.js, mongodb atlas as database and mongoose for ORMs

It has both frontend and backend together here currently it is not completely functional but login with ID abc@gmail.com with password 12345678  it functions It adds the expense but currently it is not showing its management.

The use of AI is also involved in this because I had to complete the task in limited timeframe but I make sure I understand what AI is giving I am just using it to enhance my speed.

The project also have errors as of now becuase I had to learn few new concepts inorder to implement them.

ThankYou for reviewing and giving me a chance
